A few unit tests have been implemented
using Google Test.

The tests are automatically built with CMake / Make.

They can be run using "make test", or better, by running
the "runUnitTests"(.exe) binary in the build folder.

The dependency to GTest is packaged as a subfolder.
GTest runs on Windows, Linux and OS X.

The tests can be found in the file "awele_tests.cpp".
